    text: `I was absolutely blessed by a higher power to have been introduced to and worked with Adrian. Let me tell you, if there were a way to rate Adrian and Top Mortgage Rate 100 stars, I would.

I found myself in a VERY messy situation due to poor counsel from my previous team of "professionals" and nearly lost my new build home along with my entire deposit. By some stroke of luck, I was given Adrian's information by a family friend who knew of them through her own real estate grapevine. From day one, I explained the situation to Adrian, and they didn't hesitate—"I got you." They said those three words with zero hesitation and absolute conviction.

Over the following couple of weeks, I not only witnessed Adrian accomplish what the previous team couldn't, but more importantly, I felt supported and advocated for—something I hadn't felt at all with the previous team. (And because it was a new build, I had been working with them for the better part of two years.)

Being my first property, I naturally had a bunch of rookie questions. But given the circumstances and how dire the situation was, my anxieties and diligence definitely amplified the questions. At no point did Adrian make me feel like a bother, even though I know I probably annoyed the heck out of them. They always made time to call me, respond to my texts, and reassure me. The reassurance alone was more than I could have asked for, but they went a step further and introduced me to a team of legal professionals who also outperformed my last "team" in just 2.5 weeks.

I could go on all day trying to explain why Adrian and the team at Top Mortgage Rate are the absolute best option for you, but I'd be wasting more of your time that you could be using to get in contact with them. So, I'm done.

Thank you, Adrian, Mike, Tai, and the entire Top Mortgage Rate team for quite literally saving me—you guys are the BEST.

Now, GET IN CONTACT WITH THEM!`,

This is my second mortgage with them, and both times they've been incredibly prompt, suggested ideas I didn't even think of on structure and term originally, and always found me rates well below what any of my friends were being quoted elsewhere. Mike even goes the extra mile to ensure that you receive the benefit of any updated rate drops up until closing... something that most people wouldn't do after they've gotten you approved. Can't recommend this team more!`,

    text: `As it was my first time buying a home and going through the process of a private sale, I couldn't ask for a more knowledgeable, friendly, detailed, and prompt mortgage specialist than Adrian. While I feel like I had several "rookie" questions, Adrian was always a complete pro and simplified everything. They communicated with me with ease, and I felt well supported throughout the process.
"Top Mortgage Rate" is an appropriate name, as Adrian helped get me an outstanding rate. Don't inundate yourself researching elsewhere. Enjoy the peace of mind that I did, and contact them today.`,

    text: `I can’t explain in words how stressful it is to get a mortgage in today’s climate in Ontario. Tai made this process as smooth as possible. They were in constant contact with us and tried to push the bank with impossible deadlines to make the deal happen for us. They were in contact with our lawyer, realtor, and took care of every detail! We had a very short close and bought the house without pre-approval. It was crazy, and they pulled it off! You can’t get better service. You are our hero, Tai!`,

When we were crunched for time and things seemed to be going crazy, Mike and their team were right there in the crazy with us, searching and finding a way to get the ball rolling. We truly appreciate all the tireless effort you put in to make our dream a reality. From our family and hearts, a big THANK YOU!

    text: `Mike truly went above and beyond to help us secure financing for our first home purchase at a really great rate. Our home purchase was a private sale, which had a few additional quirks, and Mike was adept at walking us through every step. They were extremely responsive to emails and calls and also had a great line of communication with our lender, which helped with fulfilling all our conditions. When they were recovering from surgery, they ensured we were connected with their helpful colleagues Nikolina and Kal in case we needed anything. I absolutely recommend them to anyone looking for a mortgage broker!`,

    text: `The team at Top Mortgage Rate is fantastic! I recently purchased a new house, and I had been pre-approved through one of the big banks at a rate that I knew to be good. With only a few weeks left to closing, I reached out to Tai for a second opinion after a referral from a friend. I figured it was a long shot, but the team sprang into action and not only got me a much better rate, they were able to do it with very quick turnaround time. Special shoutout to Tai, who guided me through the whole process—they are on top of it, super positive, and an absolute pleasure to work with. I highly recommend them!!`,

    text: `Adrian has been wonderful to deal with. They helped find a solution for my 86-year-old mother, who can remain in her large home while we have a smaller home built for her. Through the entire process, Adrian set our minds at ease. They were understanding, thoughtful, and very kind. We highly recommend Top Mortgage Rate... specifically Adrian if you're looking for a mortgage specialist.`,

    text: `My initial mortgage approval fell through after the recent rate hikes, and I was recently referred to Tai to help obtain a new mortgage approval. My goodness, the experience with them was so smooth!
Being in this game for a number of years and knowing the nightmare that the process can be, I can say that they are the absolute best broker I have worked with thus far. I love that they took the time to understand our unique situation (recognizing that each client's profile is different) and found a way to get us a good deal. I was also able to rest easy throughout the entire process, knowing that they were only a phone call or text message away.

I highly recommend Tai and their team for your mortgage needs!`,
